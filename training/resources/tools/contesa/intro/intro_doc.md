*ConTesA*, the **Con**formance **Tes**ting **A**ssistant from the
[NIEM tool set](https://www.niem.gov/tools-catalog), is a web-based
tool capable of validating a document against the NIEM Naming and
Design Rules (NDR). Complex standards often contain rules, and
*ConTesA* was developed to take the various technologies (XML
Schema, RelaxNG, Schematron, etc.) that aid in formalizing these
rules and leveraging them to do what they do best.
