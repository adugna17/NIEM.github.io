*ConTesA*, the **Con**formance **Tes**ting **A**ssistant from the
[NIEM tool set](https://www.niem.gov/tools-catalog), is a web-based tool capable of
validating a document against the [NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR)](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/specification/naming-and-design-rules/4.0/niem-ndr-4.0.html).
Complex standards often contain rules, and *ConTesA* was developed to
take the various technologies ([XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/standards/xml/schema),
[RelaxNG](http://www.relaxng.org/), [Schematron](http://schematron.com/an-overview-of-schematron/), etc.)
that aid in formalizing these rules and leveraging them to do what they
do best.
